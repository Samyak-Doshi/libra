1) If you're getting a lot of Libra module import errors like: 
        from dataset_labelmatcher import get_similar_column, get_similar_model
        ImportError: No module named grammartree

        Add this to the top of your file right underneath the import sys:

        sys.path.append('/User/path_to_libra_folder/Libra/') 

2) Make sure that your python packages are installing in the right place. They need to be stored at:
    /lib/site/python-packages.

    To see where your packages are being installed take any of them and do:
        pip show package-name

3) If you're getting this AttributeError: 
    AttributeError: 'EarlyStopping' object has no attribute '_implements_train_batch_hooks

    replace line 25: tensorflow.keras.callbacks instead of keras.callbacks

4)If you're getting an error related to installing Textblob:
	either go into your folder from terminal, and then pip install 

	or

	make sure that you're treated each of the folders as source folders

    or

    try installing a gcc compiler and then retrying 

5) If you've previous installed anaconda on your machine, and are getting unable to import module errors. Make sure that your libraries are being installed in the right place. 
	It should not be installing in /anaconda/ paths. 

6) If you're trying to run the codebase and it keeps saying you have to install this: nltk.download('averaged_perception_tagger')
    include: 

    import nltk
    nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
